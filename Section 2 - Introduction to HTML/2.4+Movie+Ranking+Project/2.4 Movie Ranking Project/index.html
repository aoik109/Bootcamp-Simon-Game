<h1>The Best Movies According to Allison</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>Spiderman: Across the Spider-Verse</h3>
<p>Breathtaking art with a wide variety of artstyles. The big chase with 
    all the spider people was INSANE.
</p>

<h3>Captain America: The First Avenger</h3>
<p>Amazing plotline and characters. The action scenes were 
    great! I loved seeing how Chris Evans became Captain America.
</p>

<h3>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</h3>
<p> Best humor. I was laughing the whole time. Got to see Rocket's backstory
